        "\n",
        "    - The difference between interpreted and compiled languages mainly lies in how the code is executed, and Python is an interpreted language,Python is often categorized as an interpreted language, but there’s a twist: Python code is first compiled into bytecode (a lower-level representation) before being interpreted. This bytecode is what the Python interpreter executes. So while Python is \"technically\" interpreted, it does involve a compilation step into bytecode, but this happens behind the scenes.When you run a Python script, it’s first compiled to .pyc (Python Compiled file) or .pyo (Optimized file) before being interpreted.\n",

        "    - The finally block in Python’s exception handling is used to define code that should always run, no matter what—whether an exception was raised or not.The finally block is your safety net—it guarantees that certain important actions are always carried out, helping prevent things like memory leaks or open file handles.\n",

        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. It's used to define behavior that should happen when an object is about to be destroyed—usually when it's no longer needed and Python’s garbage collector is about to clean it up.\n",

        "    - Both multithreading and multiprocessing are techniques used to achieve concurrent execution in Python, but they are suited for different types of tasks and operate in distinct ways.Multithreading Involves running multiple threads within a single process. Each thread shares the same memory space and resources. Multithreading is best for I/O-bound tasks (tasks that spend time waiting, such as file I/O, network operations, database queries, etc.), because while one thread waits for I/O, other threads can keep executing. Multiprocessing Involves running multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. Processes are independent of each other.Multiprocessing is ideal for CPU-heavy tasks, like complex calculations, data processing, or tasks that involve heavy computation.\n",

        "    - The try and except blocks are the core components of exception handling in Python. They allow your program to catch and handle errors gracefully, so it doesn't crash when something goes wrong during execution.The try block is where you place code that might raise an exception. It tells Python to “try” running the code, and if an error occurs, the program should look for a way to handle it.The except block handles the exception if something goes wrong in the try block. You can catch specific types of errors (like ZeroDivisionError or ValueError) or handle all exceptions generally.\n",
